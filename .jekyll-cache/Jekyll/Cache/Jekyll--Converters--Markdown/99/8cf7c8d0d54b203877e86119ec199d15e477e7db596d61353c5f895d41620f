I"E<p>Univox Media is an advertising startup that came to us to establish their brand on the web. Their branding design work was done by Avive Design so our job was to ensure that the brand identity carried through to their website. We were able to make that content stand out with minimalist design choices and animations. Univox wanted a fast, secure site and wanted to leave content updates to us. Based on those requirements, we chose to build the site using Jekyll, a static site generator. The results speak for themselves: an extremely secure site thatâ€™s lightning fast.</p>

Update to the BCBS Massachusetts health care delivery system map. Massachusetts has 15 major hospital systems, 64 acute hospitals, 55 community health centers, 9 provider networks, and 169 major medical groups. The map would allow a user to explore the relationships between HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS and PROVIDER GROUPS in the Commonwealth.

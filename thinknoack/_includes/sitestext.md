  main: | 
    <p>Synapse Product Development solves the most difficult engineering challenges from the concept stage through manufacturing for the leading entertainment, consumer electronics, life-sciences, and healthcare companies and organizations in the world. Synapse provides mechanical, electrical and software engineering services. They also supply essential project management and innovative product design assistance to a broad range of clients from garage inventors to Fortune 500 companies. Synapse is headquartered in Seattle, Washington with additional offices in San Francisco and Hong Kong.</p><p>I was referred to Synapse by a former and very generous client to whom I owe huge thanks and gratitude. Synapse was looking to upgrade their existing site to accommodate for their growth, add a new design, newer technologies, and to change their presence to be more in line with the quality of work they provide. In collaboration with fellow Developers/Designers Tim and Matt, of Eclipse Media Solutions, we created a site that is clean and technical as well as exciting to look at and explore. The final result: a site that can show off their work and attract new clients while giving them total control over built in features.</p><p>We worked closely with the Synapse to fully actualize the ideas and thoughts they provided, giving our thoughts and other ideas for exciting technologies/designs, and always moving to a more client and user friendly site (finding that place where great things happen).</p>Synapse.com was built on the Drupal frame work and is a fully functioning Mobile website ready for use on phones and tablets of all kinds. To see some of the great features used on Synapse just visit the site and have fun exploring this multidimensional, user-friendly site!</p>

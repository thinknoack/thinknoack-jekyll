Pacific Lamp is a full-service lighting and energy efficiency provider in Oregon and SW Washington. We worked with them to build a fully customized Drupal Commerce site for their wholesale operations. The extensive catalog makes use of Drupal's Search API to provide a highly interactive search that allows the user to filter bulbs, fixtures, and accessories by a variety of facets and attributes (as well as keyword search). In addition to the e-commerce portion of the site, users can also calculate their potential savings after making lighting upgrades, see example projects and learn all about the variety and usage of bulbs and lighting solutions.

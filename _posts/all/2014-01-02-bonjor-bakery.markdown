I was Hired by Bon Jour Bakery to create a label and brochure for their new product. With the charm of Parisian bakeries in mind, I captured the essence of this radically new product for this start up company. Complying with restrictions and requirements for this company to launch to vendors such as Whole Foods and Trader Joeâ€™s, I worked with Bon Jour to create a label fit for the product and its message.

The new Drupal 8 site for Warn Automotive, an automotive parts manufacturer, gave me another opportunity to help a new company establish their online presence. The site was built in order to help Warn Automotive better target the OEM market. This is another site that I developed and executed with the team of at HMH Agency who helped ensure that the process was smooth from start to finish. The site is a single page site with subtle animations to draw the user's eye to the visuals and thus keep them engaged with the information on the page.
